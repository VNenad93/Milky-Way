If you’re a parent to a colicky baby, you know just how tough those first months can be. Our white noise machine was an absolute game-changer during that challenging newborn stage. Our baby cried a lot due to colic, and putting her to sleep often felt impossible. We tried countless methods to soothe her, but two things helped the most swaddling and white noise.

Let’s be honest—when you have a colicky baby, nothing works like magic. But the white noise machine did help create a calming environment, giving us a few precious moments of peace and helping her settle down enough to sleep. Now, my daughter is 11 months old, and white noise is still a part of our routine. It signals to her that it’s time to wind down and get ready for bed, which has made bedtime so much easier and predictable.

I’d recommend a white noise machine to any parent, especially those dealing with sleep challenges. It doesn’t solve everything, but it truly has been one of our best tools for creating a calm and comforting sleep routine!
